He quickly understood the domain, picked up complex requirements, and turned them into clear, effective scenarios. His ability to learn fast and write clean, maintainable code stood out. He brought a great attitude to the team—always positive, curious, and ready to help. His passion for sports like cricket and football also added to his strong team spirit. Johann has a bright future in software development, and I’m happy to recommend him.",
